# Phytoremediation of Soil
## Introduction

Welcome to the **Phytoremediation of Soil** project! This project was developed as part of the Smart India Hackathon 2022 (SIH 2022) competition, where we emerged as internal finalists. Phytoremediation is a sustainable and eco-friendly method of using plants to clean contaminated soils. This project aims to explore various aspects of phytoremediation and demonstrate its effectiveness through practical implementation and data analysis.

## Project Overview

Phytoremediation is the use of green plants and their associated microorganisms to remove, degrade, or contain hazardous contaminants in soil, sludge, sediment, surface water, or groundwater. This project focuses on:

- Identifying suitable plant species for phytoremediation
- Analyzing soil samples to determine contamination levels
- Implementing phytoremediation techniques
- Monitoring and analyzing the effectiveness of the process

## Features

- **Plant Selection:** Database of plants effective for phytoremediation.
- **Soil Analysis:** Tools and methods for analyzing soil contamination levels.
- **Implementation Guide:** Step-by-step instructions for setting up a phytoremediation project.
- **Monitoring System:** Mechanisms for tracking the progress and effectiveness of the remediation process.
- **Data Visualization:** Graphs and charts to visualize data collected during the project.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
- Soil testing kits
- Various plant species for phytoremediation

## Usage

1. **Prepare Soil Samples:** Follow the instructions in the `docs/soil_analysis.md` file to prepare and analyze soil samples.

2. **Select Plants:** Use the plant selection tool in the `scripts/plant_selection.py` script to choose suitable plants for your soil type.

3. **Implement Phytoremediation:** Set up your phytoremediation project as detailed in the `docs/implementation_guide.md`.

4. **Monitor Progress:** Use the monitoring system in the `notebooks/monitoring.ipynb` notebook to track and analyze the effectiveness of the remediation process.

5. **Visualize Data:** Generate visual reports using the data visualization tools in the `notebooks/data_visualization.ipynb` notebook.
